          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>
            Java is my most experienced language. I've made some major and minor projects including my bachelor in 'Shortest Paths' 
            and an app 'HeavyMetalDK'. The latter was made in Android Studio. This also includes making games like 'Minesweeper' 
            and 'Tic-Tac-Toe', which can be seen under my projects or in my

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            Is my second most experienced language. I enjoy using it as I think it's concise and simplistic. I've mostly
            used it in smaller projects for data visualization, games or scripting, but also in 'Machine Learning' at University.

          <h3>App-development</h3>
          <p>
            My favourite projects have been app development. At University we made an app for HeavyMetal.dk which is currently 
            deployed in the 'Play Store'. I learned a lot about App development from this project. I also have some experience 
            making apps in Flutter. This includes a 'Contacts App' and a small 'Pokedex'.

        software developer living in Aarhus

      <div class="about-me__hobby">
        <p>
          I'm a 24 years old male, currently living and studying in Aarhus and
          have been doing so for the past 3 years. In summer 2020, I will
          finish my Bachelor in Computer Science and are currently looking for some work.
          I'm looking forward to applying my knowledge from the University in real-life
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a person, I am smiling and enjoying life. I love to travel and have been all around the world during
          my gap years and in my summer vacations. My most memorable journeys have taking me all over South-East Asia, where
          diving has become my new favourite hobby. At home, I use my spare time with friends, Netflix and sports, mostly floorball, where I 
          play at the local club, Team Ã…rhus Floorball. I also enjoy watching sports, almost anything, but my favourite is football both 
          European and American.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in programming and software started in High School/Gymnasium with the subject 'Information Technologies',
          and since then it has evolved and was the main reason I picked Computer Science at University. I love technology in general, 
          and I always try to keep up with the newest trends in both Software and Hardware.
